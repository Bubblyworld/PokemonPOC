# Pokemon Proof of Concept

## Overview
I felt like writing up a clone of pokemon red (or parts of it, at least) so I could mess around with it. Always wanted to do this at some point - ideally I'd like to add proper networking so that multiple people can walk around in the same map.

## Compilation
To compile, you need to link it with the Slick2D library.
